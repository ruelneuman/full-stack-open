# Full Stack Open 2021
This repository contains my projects and solutions for parts 0 through 9 of the [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki.

The course covers many important topics of full stack web development such as:
- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- Express
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
- TypeScript

The course was estimated to take about 20 hours per part to complete. However, to maximize my learning potential I generally spent anywhere from 25 to 40 hours per part. I found this extra time to be very beneficial. I was able to review my code and refator it for better readablity and ease of maintenance.

A summary of the course contents is found below:

## Part 0 - [Fundamentals of Web Apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0)

Goes over the basics of web development including HTTP requests, JSON, the Document Object Model, and JavaScript libraries.

## Part 1 - [Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1)

Introduces React including props, event handlers, and state management.

Projects:

- [Anecdotes](https://github.com/ruelneuman/full-stack-open/tree/master/part1/anecdotes) - A page that shows the user random anecdotes that can be voted upon.

## Part 2 - [Communicating with the Server](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2)

Introduces communication with the backend. Topics include HTTP requests using axios, 3rd party APIs, forms, and rendering collections of data from the server.

Projects:
- [Course Info 2](https://github.com/ruelneuman/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2/courseinfo2) - A continuation of the project from the part 1 that has been refactored into a more maintainable structure
- [Countries](https://github.com/ruelneuman/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2/countries) - A page that pulls country and weather data from 3rd party APIs as the user searches for country names.
